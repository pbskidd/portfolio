# Prompt for AI Web Builder: Portfolio Website

## Objective

Build a visually stunning, inspirational, and responsive portfolio website for a custom branded blankets company, using the provided wireframe and gallery structure. The site should capture visitors’ imagination, drive exploration, and generate high-quality inquiries from corporate clients.

## Core Design Considerations

- The website must be **visually aspirational**—think editorial luxury, art gallery curation, and storytelling through images.
- Use **rich animations** and immersive visual effects throughout, leveraging **TailwindCSS** (tailwind.js) for styling and layout, and **three.js** for advanced and interactive 3D or parallax elements.
- All icons throughout the site should be loaded dynamically from a set of Favicons; allow for icon selection and variation across sections for a modern, dynamic look.
- The site **must be fully responsive**, maintaining elegance and usability on all devices (desktop, tablet, mobile).

## Special Horizontal Sections to Include

  [https://single-slide-e3ga4j5.gamma.site/](https://single-slide-e3ga4j5.gamma.site/)

- **B.** Add a horizontal section with the content and background image from:  
  [https://gamma.app/docs/Blank-2-xo96odzhhktsmm2?mode=present#card-hiqh2rum9r0jmqw](https://gamma.app/docs/Blank-2-xo96odzhhktsmm2?mode=present#card-hiqh2rum9r0jmqw)

- **C.** Add a horizontal section with the content and image from:  
  [https://untitled-xddmb38.gamma.site/](https://untitled-xddmb38.gamma.site/)

Each of these sections should be integrated seamlessly into the site, using responsive layouts and rich animated transitions. Respect the original design intent and aesthetic of the referenced sections, but ensure they fit cohesively within the overall brand and flow.

## Animation & Immersion Requirements

- Use **tailwind.js** for all styling, spacing, typography, and layout.
- Use **three.js** to create immersive visual effects—parallax scrolling, animated backgrounds, or interactive 3D elements—especially in hero, gallery, and special horizontal sections.
- Animate transitions between sections and on scroll; use microinteractions for buttons and cards.
- Load and use Favicons as the icon set throughout; allow for icon selection by section and ensure variety.

---

## Additional Guidelines

- All images should be optimized for fast loading (use responsive image sets).
- Prioritize accessibility: color contrast, alt text, keyboard navigation.
- SEO-friendly: use semantic HTML, meta tags, open graph data.
- Include sticky CTAs and smooth navigation.
-  Output as HTML, CSS and Javascript files but script libraries can be linked to online resources. Save images and video to an “img” directory.
- Take inspiration from each organization's website, if possible, copy videos and images.
- if a referenced image cannot be found, look for other images for this entity, if not found, either draw one, or source a relevant image from stock image libraries, or just use a placeholder image
